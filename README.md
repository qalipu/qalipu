## Spring Boot

From the spring boot website:
> Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

## Vaadin

From the Vaadin Framework:
> Vaadin Framework is a Java UI framework that simplifies your web app development. Your code is written in Java and executed on the serverâ€™s JVM, while the UI is rendered as HTML5 in the browser. The framework also automates all the communication between the browser and the server. 

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine (and other platforms).

## Keycloak

From wikipedia:

>Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services.

## karibu-dsl
